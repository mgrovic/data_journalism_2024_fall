2016 data has 104,046 rows and 19 columns
2020 data has 209,983 rows and 19 columns 
2024 data has 160,472 rows and 19 columns

In terms of time frame, we have access to the General Election data from 2016, 2020 and 2024, which will allow us to explore the change in early voting over different election cycles. Because we have access to different time frames of data, there aren't any looming limits for the data. Some of our questions reference demographics, (ie "How do economic factors like household income and unemployment rates impact early voter voter turnout across Maryland counties?" and "Are certain counties or demographic groups turning out in higher numbers for early voting compared to previous elections?") and the data set does include some demographic data, including gender, political party affiliation and age group, we do lack other common demographics such as race, household income and unemployment rates. What we may have to do is locate that demographic data from individual counties and compare it to the early voting data we have now. 

#Question 4: 
#How does early voting turnout correlate with registered party affiliation across Maryland counties? 

```{r}

  clean_names() |>  #clean data 
  group_by(county_name) |> # more than 200,000 rows of data (as this data set originally had each early voting location as its own individual data point.) Now only 24 rows.
   summarise(
    total_voters = n(),
    dem = sum(party_code == "DEM", na.rm = TRUE),
    rep = sum(party_code == "REP", na.rm = TRUE),

    una = sum(party_code == "UNA", na.rm = TRUE),
    lib = sum(party_code == "LIB", na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>
  
  #there was a column called "party_code" which either had a DEM, REP, OTH etc, to signify political party. to make my own columns, i summarized to create the new columns, which just have the total number of early voters by political party. 
  mutate(
    percent_dem = (dem / total_voters) * 100,
    percent_rep = rep / total_voters * 100
  ) |> 
  #made new columns to show what percent of the early voters in each county were Dem and which percent were Rep. Honestly not a very significant trend to me here. The counties that tend to lean red seem to have a higher percentage of Rep early voters and vice-versa.

#Question 3: 
#Are certain counties turning out in higher numbers for early voting compared to previous elections? 


#A
```{r}
#For each year, I cleaned the data, made the percent total number a DBL and renamed the percent total to its respective year. I selected only the county and the total percent of eligible voters who voter early. For this question, the total number of voters on any given day was not needed.

  # this final table, depending on how you arrange, will answer question  3. From 2020 to 2024 there are two counties experiencing a major increase of the total percent of eligible voters who voted early. Calvert (nearly 60% change) and Washington (40% change). Washington County is quite interesting, as it has the highest net increase, as from 2016 to 2024, it's percentage of early voters increase by almost exactly 100%.

#Question 1: What is the percentage change of early voters from an election prior to covid (or 2020) to after covid? 

#Answer: This is quite similar to question three. You can look at the percent change for each county, but here is the total percent change 

```{r}
total_percent_changes <- q_3_final |>
  summarise(
   avg_change_24_20 = mean(percent_change_24_20, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_change_24_16 = mean(percent_change_24_16, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_change_20_16 = mean(percent_change_20_16, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

#Question 5 
#How do economic factors like household income and unemployment rates impact early voter turnout across Maryland counties? 

```{r}

 md_data <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  variables = c(
    unemployment = "B23025_005",
    labor_force = "B23025_003",
    median_income = "B19013_001"

 mutate(
    # Clean up county names by removing " County, Maryland"
    county_name = gsub(" County, Maryland", "", county_name),
    # Rename Baltimore to Baltimore County
    county_name = gsub("^Baltimore$", "Baltimore County", county_name),
    # Rename "Baltimore city, Maryland" to "Baltimore City"
    county_name = gsub("Baltimore city, Maryland", "Baltimore City", county_name)
  )
  
#i used chatgpt for this mutate function. I was unsure how to fix all the names of the counties and keep Baltimore County and make Baltimore City correct so i asked how to change the county_names to fit the format so i could bind this data set to the early voting data set.
