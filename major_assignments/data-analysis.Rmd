2016 data has 104,046 rows and 19 columns
2020 data has 209,983 rows and 19 columns 
2024 data has 160,472 rows and 19 columns

In terms of time frame, we have access to the General Election data from 2016, 2020 and 2024, which will allow us to explore the change in early voting over different election cycles. Because we have access to different time frames of data, there aren't any looming limits for the data. Some of our questions reference demographics, (ie "How do economic factors like household income and unemployment rates impact early voter voter turnout across Maryland counties?" and "Are certain counties or demographic groups turning out in higher numbers for early voting compared to previous elections?") and the data set does include some demographic data, including gender, political party affiliation and age group, we do lack other common demographics such as race, household income and unemployment rates. What we may have to do is locate that demographic data from individual counties and compare it to the early voting data we have now. 

#Most newsworhty thing about the data so far.
Change in early voting from 2020 to 2024: -7.504786 %
Change in early voting from 2016 to 2020: 44.98002 %
Change in early voting from 2016 to 2024: 27.02911 %

There was an obvious jump in early voting from 2016 to 2020, I assume due to the pandemic. However I assumed that early voting levels would level back out to 2016 numbers, but it seems that they remain high, with a 27% increase from 2016 to 2024 and only a 7.5% decrease from 2020. 

Also the three counties with the highest percentage of early voters, all fell in the top 5 for lowest unemployment rate 
#2 Talbot	Unemploymet: 3.173432		early voter: 32.80	
#3 Calvert	Unemploymet 3.180552		early voter 33.65	
#5 Queen Anne's	Unemploymet 3.633084		early voter 33.87	

#Question 4: 
#How does early voting turnout correlate with registered party affiliation across Maryland counties? 

Democratic counties have more Democratic early voters, while Republican counties have more Republican early voters, reflecting their political leanings. This shows that early voting turnout aligns with voter demographics. Overall, the data matches typical voting patterns. because Maryland is an overwhelmingly democratic state there are definitely a higher number of democratic early voters, just due to the politics of the state,

    percent_rep = rep / total_voters * 100
  ) |> 
  #made new columns to show what percent of the early voters in each county were Dem and which percent were Rep. Honestly not a very significant trend to me here. The counties that tend to lean red seem to have a higher percentage of Rep early voters and vice-versa.

#Question 3: 
#Are certain counties turning out in higher numbers for early voting compared to previous elections? 


#A
this final table, depending on how you arrange, will answer question  3. From 2020 to 2024 there are two counties experiencing a major increase of the total percent of eligible voters who voted early. Calvert (nearly 60% change) and Washington (40% change). Washington County is quite interesting, as it has the highest net increase, as from 2016 to 2024, it's percentage of early voters increase by almost exactly 100%. 

```{r}

#Question 1: What is the percentage change of early voters from an election prior to covid (or 2020) to after covid? 

#Answer: This is quite similar to question three. You can look at the percent change for each county, but here is the total percent change 

 Early voting saw a 27% increase from 2016 to 2024, showing that the shift toward early voting during the pandemic has had a lasting impact. While turnout dipped slightly by 7.5% from 2020 to 2024, it still remained much higher than in 2016. This trend highlights how early voting has become a more popular option for many voters across the country.


```{r}
total_percent_changes <- q_3_final |>
 #these summarise functions take the mean of the percent change for all the counties and find the average 
   summarise(
   avg_change_24_20 = mean(percent_change_24_20, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_change_24_16 = mean(percent_change_24_16, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_change_20_16 = mean(percent_change_20_16, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

#Question 5 
#How do economic factors like median income and unemployment rates impact early voter turnout across Maryland counties? 
The three counties with the highest percentage of early voters, all fell in the top 5 for lowest unemployment rate: 

2 Talbot	Unemployment: 3.173432	early voter: 32.80	
3 Calvert	Unemployment 3.180552		early voter 33.65	
5 Queen Anne's	Unemployment 3.633084	 early voter 33.87



Baltimore City (58349 median income, 13.40% early voter turnout) and Allegheny County (55248 median income, 16.59% early voter turnout), are in the bottom four of counties in terms of median income, and are the two counties with the lowest early voter turn out. 





 Counties with lower unemployment and higher incomes see more people turning out for early voting, showing that economic stability can make it easier for people to participate. When life is a little less stressful financially, it might be simpler to make time to vote early. This pattern shows how a communityâ€™s economic situation can influence voter turnout.

#Question 2: What is the relationship between the proportion of eligible voters and early voter turnout in recent elections, and how do demographics explain differences across counties?

#Answer 2: Counties with more eligible voters tend to have higher early voting turnout. Demographics like education don't explain the differences between counties as much as expected.

There may (loose trend) be a loose trend where the lower the percentage of people with no school experience, the higher the early voter turnout, however there are definitively a few outliers.
